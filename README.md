This python program emulates a slot machine.

This program asks the user to enter a deposit and asks to bet up to three lines. 

Different symbols are available from:
"A", "B", "C", and "D"
Each symbol has a different rarity. The more rare, the greater the multiplier. 

This program outputs how much is won, how much is won on each line, and updates the total balance.
